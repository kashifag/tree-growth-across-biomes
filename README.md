# 🌳 Tree Growth Across Biomes
### *A Dynamic Visualization of Hierarchical Models — Built with Streamlit + Python*

![cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/00000000/forest-cover.gif)

> *"Not all trees grow alike — but they still follow the same laws of nature."*  
> This interactive app explores how tree height relates to trunk diameter across five biomes,  
> and how different statistical pooling strategies can change our understanding of growth.

## 🧠 What This Project Shows
This project brings the idea of **hierarchical (mixed-effects) models** to life.  
It compares three modeling philosophies:

| 🌿 Mode | 🔍 Description | 🧮 Model |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **No Pooling** | Each biome builds its *own* regression — great freedom, high variance. | `OLS per biome` |
| **Complete Pooling** | Treats all trees as one forest — ignores biome identity. | `Global OLS` |
| **Partial Pooling** | Biomes share information through random effects — the best of both worlds. | `MixedLM (random intercepts & slopes)` |

The “shrinkage” you see in the partial-pooling view shows how small, noisy groups borrow strength from the global trend — a cornerstone idea in modern biostatistics, ecology, and genomics.

## Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Core language |
| **Streamlit** | Interactive web app |
| **Plotly** | Dynamic, colorful visualization |
| **Statsmodels** | Linear & mixed-effects models |
| **Pandas + NumPy** | Data simulation & manipulation |

## Why It Matters (Bioinformatics Angle)
Hierarchical thinking appears everywhere in biology:
- **Gene expression:** cells nested within individuals  
- **Clinical trials:** patients nested within sites  
- **Ecology:** trees nested within biomes  

Partial pooling lets us capture **both shared biology and local variation** — exactly the balance real data demands.

Quick Summary
This project visualizes how data-sharing between groups (partial pooling) stabilizes models in biology and ecology; a fun, hands-on example of statistics meeting nature.
